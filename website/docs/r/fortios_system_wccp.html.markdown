Configure WCCP.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "fortios_system_wccp" "trname" {
  assignment_bucket_format = "cisco-implementation"
  assignment_dstaddr_mask  = "0.0.0.0"
  assignment_method        = "HASH"
  assignment_srcaddr_mask  = "0.0.23.65"
  assignment_weight        = 0
  authentication           = "disable"
  cache_engine_method      = "GRE"
  cache_id                 = "1.1.1.1"
  forward_method           = "GRE"
  group_address            = "0.0.0.0"
  primary_hash             = "dst-ip"
  priority                 = 0
  protocol                 = 0
  return_method            = "GRE"
  router_id                = "1.1.1.1"
  router_list              = "\"1.0.0.0\" "
  server_type              = "forward"
  service_id               = "1"
  service_type             = "auto"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `service_id` - (Required) Service ID.
* `router_id` - IP address known to all cache engines. If all cache engines connect to the same FortiGate interface, use the default 0.0.0.0.
* `cache_id` - IP address known to all routers. If the addresses are the same, use the default 0.0.0.0.
* `group_address` - IP multicast address used by the cache routers. For the FortiGate to ignore multicast WCCP traffic, use the default 0.0.0.0.
* `server_list` - IP addresses and netmasks for up to four cache servers.
* `router_list` - IP addresses of one or more WCCP routers.
* `ports_defined` - Match method.
* `server_type` - Cache server type.
* `ports` - Service ports.
* `authentication` - Enable/disable MD5 authentication.
* `password` - Password for MD5 authentication.
* `forward_method` - Method used to forward traffic to the cache servers.
* `cache_engine_method` - Method used to forward traffic to the routers or to return to the cache engine.
* `service_type` - WCCP service type used by the cache server for logical interception and redirection of traffic.
* `primary_hash` - Hash method.
* `priority` - Service priority.
* `protocol` - Service protocol.
* `assignment_weight` - Assignment of hash weight/ratio for the WCCP cache engine.
* `assignment_bucket_format` - Assignment bucket format for the WCCP cache engine.
* `return_method` -  Method used to decline a redirected packet and return it to the FortiGate.
* `assignment_method` - Hash key assignment preference.
* `assignment_srcaddr_mask` - Assignment source address mask.
* `assignment_dstaddr_mask` - Assignment destination address mask.


## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format {{service_id}}.

## Import
