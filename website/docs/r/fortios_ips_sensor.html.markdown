* `comment` - Comment.
* `replacemsg_group` - Replacement message group.
* `block_malicious_url` - Enable/disable malicious URL blocking.
* `scan_botnet_connections` - Block or monitor connections to Botnet servers, or disable Botnet scanning.
* `extended_log` - Enable/disable extended logging.
* `entries` - IPS sensor filter. The structure of `entries` block is documented below.
* `filter` - IPS sensor filter. The structure of `filter` block is documented below. (`ver <= 6.4.0`)
* `override` - IPS override rule. The structure of `override` block is documented below. (`ver <= 6.4.0`)

The `entries` block supports:

* `id` - Rule ID in IPS database (0 - 4294967295).
* `rule` - Identifies the predefined or custom IPS signatures to add to the sensor. The structure of `rule` block is documented below.
* `location` - Protect client or server traffic.
* `severity` - Relative severity of the signature, from info to critical. Log messages generated by the signature include the severity.
* `protocol` - Protocols to be examined. set protocol ? lists available protocols. all includes all protocols. other includes all unlisted protocols.
