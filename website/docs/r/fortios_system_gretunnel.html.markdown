  checksum_reception           = "disable"
  checksum_transmission        = "disable"
  dscp_copying                 = "disable"
  interface                    = "port3"
  ip_version                   = "4"
  keepalive_failtimes          = 10
  keepalive_interval           = 0
  key_inbound                  = 0
  key_outbound                 = 0
  local_gw                     = "3.3.3.3"
  local_gw6                    = "::"
  name                         = "gretunnel1"
  remote_gw                    = "1.1.1.1"
  remote_gw6                   = "::"
  sequence_number_reception    = "disable"
  sequence_number_transmission = "enable"
}
```
